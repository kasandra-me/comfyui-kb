# ComfyUI KB – Repo
This repository hosts a live Markdown knowledge base for ComfyUI AI assistants.

## Files
- `knowledge.md` – the main document. **Automation appends updates at the end.**

## Automation idea
Use Zapier/Make to watch RSS/Atom feeds and **append** a new bullet to the end of `knowledge.md` with date + link.

## Safety
- Always keep `Updates` section at the end for simpler appends.
- If an automation fails, you can manually append a new line.
